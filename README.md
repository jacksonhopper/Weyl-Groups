# Weyl-Groups
A custom theory for Exponential Idle where you build long words in Weyl Groups!

This theory is all about Weyl groups. The main component is an element w in a Weyl group W, which can be viewed as a word written using the first few letters of the alphabet. The main goal is to make w longer (i.e. have more letters in it) by carefully selecting and purchasing letters to add on to the end. But be careful---sometimes, insteading of making your word longer, a letter will make it shorter! It is very complicated to tell in advance whether adding a certain letter will make w longer or shorter; I expect a significant amount of trial and error. If you do make w shorter, you can always purchase the same letter you just bought to bring it back to the same length. The longer w is, the faster rho grows---so see how long you can make it!
There is a second element to the theory, a "q" variable to help grow rho between letter purchases. The variable q grows according to a "q-dot" equation, and rho-dot is equal to q times 2^(length(w)). So the main way to make rho grow faster will be to buy letters that make w longer, and q will help grow rho in between letter purchases.

To complicate the theory and allow further progress over time, there are four different types of Weyl groups in use: A, D, B, and E (in that order, for a good reason), and rank grows from 3 to 8. The rank is the number of letters you can use to write the word w, and the type affects the relationships between them, determining (in a very complicated way) which letters will increase the length of w, and which will decrease it. For a given type and rank, there is a "longest word," so if you've found the longest word for your given type and rank, you will need to buy a milestone upgrade to make w longer. Whether to change type or increase rank is difficult to know in advance---if you do get stuck, try rearranging your milestones.

An additional unusual feature of my thoery is a permanent upgrade called "Letter auto-buyer" which lets the player input a string of letters to auto-buy. I added this because the normal auto-buyer would be worthless if applied to letters. If you want to play full idle, you will need to use the letter auto-buyer. The most useful feature of the letter auto-buyer is (will be---this is in progress) a setting that automatically buys current word after publishing, so you don't have to remember it and manually buy the letters every publish. Some rare players might also find the longest word for their given type and rank in advance, and never have to manually buy letters. This is the "full-idle" route, and it is not recommended.

The theory is in alpha, but I think you can at this point play and get the idea how it will feel. That said, there is a lot of work to be done still. 
Most noticeably, I have not made much progress in balancing. It does not diverge, but it is an impossibly slow theory at this point. To combat this, the current release has a "free rho" button you can tap to skip ahead and see what the theory has to offer. After improving the balance, I will remove this feature.
Secondly, this game is complicated, and I don't think it is yet fully accessible to lay people. I have multiple pages in the equation area, with the second and third pages giving hints for how to ensure the letters you buy make w longer, but they are quite cryptic. In the future I will create chapters and improve the description so that new players can learn how to play and hopefully play to e1000 rho without having to understand exactly what's going on and how it works---but I don't think it would be very fun to play without understanding some aspect of the hint on the third page.
I will need to improve stability---most egregiously, I need to somehow streamline the "add letter" algorithm, which may currently attempt to perform about 2 million multiplications (in the worst case) near the end of the theory, causing the theory to crash and destroy all progress. Even worse, the add letter algorithm is called by the "add word" algorithm potentially on the order of 100 times (although only one or two should approach the worst case).
I would also like to incorporate achievements for finding longest words, for finding interesting letter combinations, for making mistakes, and generally for exploring the mechanics. 
I will also change the logic of milestone swapping to negate milestone swap-based strategies, but to also make changing types less disruptive. As mentioned earlier, I will incorporate the feature of saving your current word after publishing in the letter auto-buyer.
I will need help localizing, from anyone who speaks English and another language well.

I hope the discussion of routing for this theory is active and interesting. Outside of buying letters, the optimal active strategy should be a q doubling, and because the equation is a "q-dot" equation, I hope doubling is not too important. Ideally the optimal active strategy won't outperform the optimal idle strategy by more than a factor of 1.3 or so.
That said, I believe routing should be pretty interesting. Different letters have different costs, and all available letters will be necessary to build long words. However, a given element w in W may actually be represented by many different words, costing different amounts in total---for example, the words aba and bab correspond to the same element w (outside of type B). However, b is a more expensive letter than a, so if you are trying to build the word aba, it is a better idea to first build the word ab so you can buy an a. If instead you build the word ba, you will have to buy the more expensive letter b. This is a small example of the kind of consideration players should make to play optimally.
I want building the longest word of E_8 to require more than e900 rho, and for the words to grow steadily longer the entire time. The longest word of E_8 is much longer than the longest letters of either B_8 or E_7, so a completionist player will spend the majority of their time working exclusively in type E_8; the final milestone will be available around e500 or so. Also, I want publishing to be available when w is around 3 letters long, and the first milestone upgrade to be available when w is the longest word in A_3. Optimal milestone routing should not leave the player waiting very long with the longest word. An alternate path will also be possible, but might involve more waiting.

I welcome all comments, but please be aware of unfinished state. In particular, if anyone has conceptual suggestions, thinks something I haven't mentioned is broken or non-functional, and especially if someone thinks I've got the math wrong, please let me know. Also, if you speak a language other than English I would greatly appreciate your help localizing.
