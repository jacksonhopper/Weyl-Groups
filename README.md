# Weyl-Groups
A custom theory for Exponential Idle where you build long words in Weyl Groups

There are two components to this theory. First, there is an element w in a Weyl group W. Second, there is a dominant character lambda in the root space of W. The player grows currency in two ways: they can buy letters to (hopefully) make w longer, or they can buy c_i upgrades to make lambda "more dominant." Making w longer helps in two ways: firstly, the growth of rho has a factor of 2^l(w), so every letter that makes w longer doubles the speed of growth of rho (and every letter that makes w shorter halves it!). Secondly, the longer w is, the further displaced w(lambda) is from lambda. But be careful---this relationship is not monotonic with each c_i! So make sure to buy the correct c_i upgrades to maximize the displacement of w(lambda) given w.
Note also that a given Weyl group element w may be represented by several different corresponding words. In particular, the order of letter purchases will affect the total cost, and especially speed, of building a given element.
To further complicate the theory, there are four different types of Weyl groups in use, controlled by milestone upgrades: A, D, B, and E. For a given type and rank, there is a "longest word" w_0. I want to make it so that the player has to build the longest word of one rank to unlock the letter for the next rank, and attempt to build it.  The order of the types is chosen so that, for each rank, a milestone upgrade will always increase the length of the longest word. (As it stands, I don't see a way around automatically shortening w upon switching types. My hope is that accidentally shortening w by a single letter should be a near-costless mistake, so hopefully I can balance things such that changing types is worthwhile as soon as it is available.)

An additional unusual feature of my thoery is a permanent upgrade called "Letter auto-buyer" which lets the player input a string of letters to auto-buy. The idea is for this to be the only way to auto-buy letters. I want it to be possible to accidentally erasing several letters by mistake when turning on the letter auto-buyer. I don't want such a mistake to be devastating, only frustrating, comparable to falling asleep while coasting.

There is a lot of work to be done before this is a playable theory. 
First and foremost, I have not set prices or levels, or balanced in any way. I know this makes it difficult to get a sense of my vision, but I wanted to share something before stalling out on this project.
Secondly, this game is quite complicated, and I don't think it is yet remotely accessible to lay people. In the future I will create chapters to put the game a little bit more on rails, reduce complexity, somewhat explain the mechanics, and invite some experimentation at the start. Right now I think the player will unlock new chapters when they find the longest word of a given Weyl group. In my head the order is A_1 -> A_2 -> A_3 -> D_4 -> B_5 -> E_6 -> E_7 -> E_8. One additional option I am considering is making rank a milestone upgrade, like type.
I would also like to incorporate about a dozen achievements, including some secret ones. 
I will need to localize, improve stability, and perhaps optimize for offline play.
Finally, there is a beta feature allowing test players to get e10 rho at the touch of a button. This will not be included in 1.0.

I hope for the optimal active strategy to be no (or not much) better than the optimal semi-idle strategy, and for that to be somewhat (but not overwhelmingly, about 2x-4x, say) better than the naive idle strategy of "buy everything" (except letters, which I will force you to buy carefully). I think it may turn out that the optimal semi-idle route is somewhat difficult to find, and welcome this possibility. This will take some testing to determine, but it seems like a likelier possibility is that the optimal semi-idle strategy involves greedily buying the cheapest letter when available and buying all c_i upgrades that contribute to the equation.
I want building the longest word of E8 to take a long time---around the same time as e100 tau, or however long starred custom theories are supposed to take. I want buying the longest word of E6 to come much earlier, roughly the amount of time it takes to buy all the milestone upgrades in a built-in theory, and I want dedicated players to spend most of their time building the longest words of E7 and E8. The lengths of available longest words are helpful here.

I welcome all comments, but please be aware of unfinished state. In particular, if anyone has conceptual suggestions, thinks something I haven't mentioned is broken or non-functional, and especially if someone thinks I've got the math wrong, please let me know.
